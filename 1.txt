A black hole is a phenomenon of physics predicted to exist by Albert Einstein’s Theory of Relativity and mostly confirmed by research done by the great Stephen Hawking. The skinny of a black hole is that it is quite the opposite of skinny. Black holes are considered the most massive single objects in the known universe. A black hole is likely at least the densest object known. Their density approaches infinity. The conceptual infinite density is derived from the idea that a black hole exists as a singularity. A singularity is a singular point in spacetime that has no volume. A singularity can have quite large mass. Since density equals mass divided by volume, the density of a true singularity would be undefined. As a result, most physicists don’t believe black holes have zero volume. Instead, it is likely that black holes occupy some volume of space. With current technology, it is impossible to determine what a black hole looks like; a black hole does not emit light and thus, information. What makes a black hole black? What does it mean to be black in a cosmic definition of the word? Black or dark are terms for cosmological objects that don’t emit or reflect light. Light, or electromagnetic radiation, makes up most of the energy we detect in the universe. Even the matter in the universe that we can investigate normally emits or reflects some form of radiation. Black holes, however, do not. Black holes are gargantuan. In nature, they tend to range from around ten times the mass of our sun to billions of solar masses. The gravity of an object that large, combined with the lack of a nuclear engine burning in a star result in a gravitational acceleration that exceeds the speed of light (making it dark or black, the absence of light).
